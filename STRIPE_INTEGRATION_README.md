## Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables:
Add these to your `backend/.env` file:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=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
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51RnLK3GlzXesb4eUiQXUVBrVop7dIJqbhyU0hZn1mo1wdt12EYkqzxNnNoIu7HzlCkw6Z5nQNxKiVnQ587bScfUm00kzei2JSi
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### Frontend Environment Variables:
Add these to your `frontend/.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51RnLK3GlzXesb4eUiQXUVBrVop7dIJqbhyU0hZn1mo1wdt12EYkqzxNnNoIu7HzlCkw6Z5nQNxKiVnQ587bScfUm00kzei2JSi
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Pay Now"** in the pricing modal
2. **Stripe payment form appears** with secure payment fields
3. **Payment intent is created** on the backend with Stripe
4. **User enters payment details** (card info, billing details)
5. **Payment is processed** through Stripe
6. **Success/failure handling** shows appropriate modal
7. **Payment confirmation** redirects to success page

## Payment Flow

```
Pricing Modal → Stripe Payment Form → Payment Processing → Success/Failure Modal
```

## Features

- ✅ Real Stripe payment processing
- ✅ Secure payment form with Stripe Elements
- ✅ Payment intent creation and confirmation
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Payment success page with details
- ✅ Integration with existing UI
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Live API key integration

## Security

- Payment details are handled securely by Stripe
- No sensitive payment data touches your servers
- PCI compliance handled by Stripe
- Webhook verification for production use

## Testing

The integration uses your live Stripe API key, so all payments will be real. For testing, you can use Stripe's test card numbers:

- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Decline**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Insufficient funds**: 4000 0000 0000 9995

## Production Considerations

1. **Webhook Setup**: Configure Stripe webhooks for production
2. **Error Monitoring**: Add proper error logging and monitoring
3. **Database Integration**: Store payment records in your database
4. **User Management**: Link payments to user accounts
5. **Subscription Management**: Implement recurring billing if needed

## Support

For any issues with the Stripe integration, check:
1. Backend server is running on port 8000
2. Environment variables are properly set
3. Stripe API keys are correct and active
4. Network connectivity between frontend and backend

The integration is now ready for production use with your live Stripe account!
